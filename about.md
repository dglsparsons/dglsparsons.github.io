Hi, I'm a full-stack engineer working at Shamaazi.

I'm responsible for a range of charity products that serve over 100,000 people, such as:
- [My Ten Nights](https://mytennights.com)
- [Give Match](https://givematch.com)
- [ZakChat](https://zakchat.com)
- [My Ten Days](https://mytendays.com)

I've been working in technology and programming since 2013.
BEng in Computer Science from the University of York, UK.

Currently I work every day using:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

Outside of tech I'm a cat lover, keen skier and a formula 1 fan.
