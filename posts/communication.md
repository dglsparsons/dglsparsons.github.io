Why effective communication is the key skill for being an awesome programmer

Programming is all about communication. We communicate with computers to tell them what we want them to do. We instruct them to carry out tasks to the finest degree of accuracy. We communicate with our peers, sharing ideas and technology. We communicate with business owners, gathering requirements and context on problems. And yet, communication is a difficult thing to get right.

Have you ever tried to write a blog, teach someone about a topic, or write a difficult email?

If you have, then you'll know how hard precise communication can be.


üó£Ô∏è Why is communication so hard

When programming, all our communication immediately becomes at least twice as difficult. Programs have to be understood by the computer so they can run. They have to be understood by future readers, people editing or maintaining them. They also have to capture exact requirements with little or no room for error. These requirements typically come from communication with non-programmers.

At the very least this means all programs are acting on around three levels of communication:
1. üó£Ô∏è A non-technical individual communicating to a developer
2. üíª A developer communicating his intent to an application
3. ü§ñ The application running and communicating to the computer

Bugs, misunderstandings and issues in translation can occur at any, or all, of these three layers. It is a game of Chinese whispers.

This game that becomes even bigger and more error prone as you scale up any teams. The more programmers working on a codebase, the more mis-communication there can be.

All this communication is even more challenging because of the huge variation in what programs can do. A web application is concerned with attractively arranging pixels on a screen. A finance application might need complex calculations to be exact to the penny/cent. A device driver might care about manipulating bespoke hardware to certain voltages. The range is huge, and this complexity is part of the reason programming can be so overwhelming.

`How we can communicate effectively

The result of this is that the quality of any communication is of critical importance. A programmer who is capable of communicating with non-technical people, other programmers and with a computer is invaluable.

It's also important to remember all the ways in which we communicate. When thinking of communication my mind always jumps straight to two people talking, or a board room full of people wearing suits.

Talking isn't the only way we communicate though, and it often isn't the best way to communicate.

Instead, there are three main topics we communicate about:
1. Code
2. Architecture - the way systems are designed and interact
3. Requirements
4. Deadlines

Requirements and deadlines are simpler, there is more research in how to structure

For code. Having clear code, that is easy to understand and digest makes life much easier. It frees up our brains to solve problems, rather than focusing on the minutae of how an application works. Just like Donald Knuth, I argue that "Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute". When writing code, optimising for readability should *always* be our primary concern. A well structured, well written codebase is far less prone to bugs, and much easier to work with.
