Why learning programming is SO HARD

Have you ever wanted to learn how to program, or to learn a new concept? Have you ever come across a technology you wanted to learn but had no idea how to get started? Does it feel like there is *too* much information about programming on the internet?

Programming is an incredibly difficult topic to break into. It's a complicated field. There's a lot of information to learn. There's a lot of opinions on the internet. The field moves amazingly fast, with new trends and technologies popping up all the time. To top it all off, guides and tutorials don't build up knowledge to an adequate level. They leave you stumbling in the dark.

But why is this? What makes all these tutorials fall short? Why can't you follow a guide and learn everything needed?

Most information on programming falls short. It is opaque for beginners for at least one of three reasons:
- It promotes misinformation, guiding you down a flawed path.
- Failing to account for the huge amount of knowledge you need beforehand.
- Focussing on low-level details, rather than overarching concepts and their rationale.

Here, I will examine each of these three flaws in turn, arguing how they all undermine successful learning. I'll then argue for a simplied approach to learning. Instead, we should be focussing on concepts and experiences over implementation.


# The HUGE amount of knowledge



# The lack of concept-driven learning


# A sea of (mis)information


# How do you avoid these problems?
